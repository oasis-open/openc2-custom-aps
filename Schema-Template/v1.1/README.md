# Profile Schemas
This folder contains three published schema packages:
1. Language Profile
    * published in the Language Specification
    * copied into all Actuator Profiles as the initial template
2. Language Types
    * published in the Language Specification
    * referenced by all Actuator Profiles using the **ls:** prefix
3. SLPF Profile
    * published in the Stateless Packet Filtering profile
    * customized from the Language Profile by deleting unneeded items
    and adding profile-specific definitions

This folder also includes two Component schemas
generated by combining one or more Profiles with the Language Types:
1. Language device
    * Processes everything defined in the Language Specification and nothing else
2. SLPF device
    * Processes everything defined in the SLPF Actuator Profile and nothing else

In Component schemas, all references to Language Types have been resolved
(copied from the Language Types schema into the Component Schema).
