#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. File anti-malware is a cyber defense mechanism that detects, corrects, and prevents malicious changes to files. This custom actuator profile defines the actions, targets, specifiers and options that are consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification in the context of file anti-malware.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope
A ‘File Anti-Malware’ (FAM) is a detective and protective mechanism that identifies malicious files based on static or dynamic values such as static content or execution in a sandbox.  A File Anti-Malware does not consider network traffic, enforce process whitelisting, or protect processes from heap spraying.  The scope of this profile is limited to File Anti-Malware herein referred to as FAM. 

This actuator profile specifies the set of actions, targets, specifiers, and command arguments that integrates FAM functionality with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) command set. Through this command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over the FAM functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the FAM function. 

All components, devices and systems that provide FAM functionality will implement the OpenC2 ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS and ARGS identified as required in this document. Actions that are applicable, but not necessarily required, for FAM will be identified as optional.

The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the required and optional OpenC2 ACTIONS for actuators with FAM functionality.
* Identify the required and optional TARGET types and associated specifiers for each action in the FAM class of actuators.
* Identify ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS,  ACTUATOR-ARGS and COMMAND-ARGS for each action-target pair that are applicable and/or unique to the FAM class of actuators
* Annotate each Action/ Target pair with a justification and example, and provide sample OpenC2 commands to a FAM with corresponding responses 
* Provide an abstract schema that captures the specifiers and options for a FAM

This FAM profile:

* Does not define or implement ACTIONS beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification.
* Is consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 may require the following components to implement the SLPF profile: 

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send commands, receive responses, and manage the execution of commands involving one or more FAM or other actuators with FAM capability. The OpenC2 producer needs _a priori_ knowledge of which commands the actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command.
* OpenC2 Consumers: Devices or instances that provide file anti-malware functions.  Typically these are actuators that execute the cyber defense function, but could be orchestrators (i.e., a device or instance that forwards commands to the actuator).  

Though cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may implement multiple actuator profiles, a particular OpenC2 message may reference at most a single actuator profile. The scope of this document is limited to FAM. 

This specification is organized into three major sections.  

Section One (this section) provides a nonnormative overview of the suite of specifications that realize OpenC2.  This section provides references as well as defines the scope and purpose of this specification. 

Section Two (normative) binds this particular profile to the OpenC2 Language Specification.  Section Two enumerates the components of the language specification that are meaningful in the context of FAM and defines components that are applicable to this distinct profile.  Section Two also defines the commands (i.e., the action target pairs) that are permitted in the context of FAM. 

Section Three (normative) presents definitive criteria for conformance so that cyber security stakeholders can be assured that their products, instances and/or integrations are compatible with OpenC2.  

This specification provides [NUMBER HERE] non-normative Annexes.  OpenC2 is intended for machine to machine interactions, therefore a schema for FAM and the applicable portions of the OpenC2 Language schema are provided to facilitate development.  There is also an Annex that provides multiple examples of FAM commands (JSON serialization).

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding
This section defines the set of ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS, and ARGS that are meaningful in the context of an FAM. This section also describes the format of the response frame's status and results field. This section organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands. 

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components 
The components of an OpenC2 command include ACTIONS, TARGETS, ACTUATORS and associated ARGS and SPECIFIERS.  Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a command-body that is meaningful in the context of an FAM.  

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 command.  The components of an OpenC2 command include: 

* ACTION:  A subset of the ACTIONs defined in the OpenC2 Language specification that are meaningful in the context of a FAM. 
    * This profile does not define ACTIONs that are external to Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification.
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the actions in the context of a FAM.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define ACTIONs in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 language specification.
* TARGET:   A subset of the TARGETs and target-specifiers defined in the Language specification that are meaningful in the context of FAM and one TARGET (and its associated specifier) that is defined in this specification. 
* ARGS:  A subset of the COMMAND-ARGS defined in the Language Specification and a set of ACTUATOR-ARGS defined in this specification.  
* ACTUATOR:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of FAM. 

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 actions defined in version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of an FAM.  The particular action/target pairs that are required or optional are presented in section 2.3.
